# Midnight Marauder - Murder on the Sky Empress

## The story, the twist and how to win
**The Story:**
In the heart of the roaring 20s, a group of diverse individuals finds themselves on a late-night journey on the luxurious transatlantic Zeppelin, 
The Sky Empress. As they soar over the Atlantic, the renowned millionaire and art collector, Leonard Van Dyke, is found dead in his private cabin, 
a priceless painting missing.
Among the passengers, the retired detective Frederick Blythe takes it upon himself to investigate. Suspects include a disgruntled artist, a wealthy 
heiress, a mysterious foreign diplomat, Van Dyke’s estranged son, and the zeppelin’s enigmatic captain.
One by one, Blythe interviews each suspect and discovers each had a reason to wish Van Dyke harm. As the plot thickens, Blythe finds a cryptic note 
in Van Dyke’s cabin reading, “Art is an illusion. So am I.”

**The Twist:**
As Blythe delves deeper into Van Dyke’s past, he finds that the millionaire had a penchant for disguises. Blythe then realizes the truth: Van Dyke 
faked his death and is hiding among the passengers, having stolen his own painting to cash in on the insurance.

**How the Player Could Win:**
Hints are scattered throughout the story. The key lies in the cryptic note, which suggests that something about Van Dyke’s persona might be a facade. 
Additionally, each passenger’s description of Van Dyke contradicts the others, suggesting that they might not all be talking about the same person. 
The stolen painting, “The Chameleon,” is also symbolic of Van Dyke’s ability to change his appearance. By connecting these dots, the player could have 
anticipated the twist before it was revealed.


## List of characters and their evidence
1. **Disgruntled Artist - Clara Deveraux:**
    - Evidence: Found paint stains on her dress that match the color palette of the stolen painting.
    - Alibi: Was seen in the dining area at the time of the murder.
    - Notes: Clara held a grudge against Van Dyke for ruining her career. She has motive, but her alibi is solid.

2. **Wealthy Heiress - Marguerite Fontaine:**
    - Evidence: Found a document revealing that Marguerite had a large debt to Van Dyke.
    - Alibi: Claims to have been in her cabin, but no one can confirm this.
    - Notes: Financial motive is clear, but she is frail and may not have been able to overpower Van Dyke.

3. **Foreign Diplomat - Alexander Petrov:**
    - Evidence: Found a letter in Petrov's cabin hinting at a dispute over a diplomatic matter with Van Dyke.
    - Alibi: Was seen chatting with the zeppelin's captain at the time of the murder.
    - Notes: Had a contentious relationship with Van Dyke, but his alibi checks out.

4. **Estranged Son - Jonathan Van Dyke:**
    - Evidence: Jonathan stands to inherit his father's fortune, including the insurance payout for the painting.
    - Alibi: Claims to have been in the library, but the librarian did not see him.
    - Notes: Strong motive, but no physical evidence linking him to the crime.

5. **Zeppelin Captain - Captain Wallace:**
    - Evidence: Has access to all cabins, including Van Dyke's.
    - Alibi: Claims to have been on the bridge. The co-pilot cannot confirm as he stepped away briefly.
    - Notes: No clear motive, but had opportunity. 

6. **Leonard Van Dyke:**
    - Evidence: Different descriptions of Van Dyke by passengers; the cryptic note hinting at illusion; a prosthetic mustache and beard found in the trash.
    - Notes: Leonard Van Dyke was known to enjoy disguises. Could he have faked his own death?

Given these logs by his assistant, Blythe might conclude that while all the passengers had motives and were suspicious in their own ways, 
none of them definitively fit the profile of the murderer. The inconsistencies in the descriptions of Van Dyke, the cryptic note, and the 
discovery of the disguise would then lead him to suspect that Van Dyke could have faked his own death.
