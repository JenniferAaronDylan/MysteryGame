# Midnight Marauder - Murder on the Sky Empress

## The story, the twist and how to win
**The Story:**
In the heart of the roaring 20s, a group of diverse individuals finds themselves on a late-night journey on the luxurious transatlantic Zeppelin, 
The Sky Empress. As they soar over the Atlantic, the renowned millionaire and art collector, Leonard Van Dyke, is found dead in his private cabin, 
a priceless painting missing.
Among the passengers, the retired detective Frederick Blythe takes it upon himself to investigate. Suspects include a disgruntled artist, a wealthy 
heiress, a mysterious foreign diplomat, Van Dyke’s estranged son, and the zeppelin’s enigmatic captain.
One by one, Blythe interviews each suspect and discovers each had a reason to wish Van Dyke harm. As the plot thickens, Blythe finds a cryptic note 
in Van Dyke’s cabin reading, “Art is an illusion. So am I.”

**The Twist:**
As Blythe delves deeper into Van Dyke’s past, he finds that the millionaire had a penchant for disguises. Blythe then realizes the truth: Van Dyke 
faked his death and is hiding among the passengers, having stolen his own painting to cash in on the insurance.

**How the Player Could Win:**
Hints are scattered throughout the story. The key lies in the cryptic note, which suggests that something about Van Dyke’s persona might be a facade. 
Additionally, each passenger’s description of Van Dyke contradicts the others, suggesting that they might not all be talking about the same person. 
The stolen painting, “The Chameleon,” is also symbolic of Van Dyke’s ability to change his appearance. By connecting these dots, the player could have 
anticipated the twist before it was revealed.


## List of characters and their evidence
1. **Disgruntled Artist - Clara Deveraux:**
    - Evidence: Found paint stains on her dress that match the color palette of the stolen painting.
    - Additional Evidence: A sketch of the stolen painting was found in her sketchbook, suggesting she had a keen interest in it.

    - Alibi: Was seen in the dining area before the estimated time of the murder, but not eating.
    - Alibi Update: A steward recalls delivering room service to her during the estimated time of the crime.

    - Notes: Clara held a grudge against Van Dyke for ruining her career. She has motive, but her alibi is solid.
    - Additional Notes: Clara's resentment toward Van Dyke is palpable, and her artistic admiration for the 
      stolen painting makes her involvement in its theft plausible.
      
    - **If Accused** Clara Deveraux: If the player accuses Clara, Blythe might explain, "Clara's resentment towards Van Dyke is clear, and her interest in the           painting is undeniable. However, she has a strong alibi. The steward vouches for her presence in the dining area during the estimated time of the murder.         Her passion for art seems more towards creation rather than destruction or theft. Her guilt is highly unlikely."

2. **Wealthy Heiress - Marguerite Fontaine:**
    - Evidence: Found a document revealing that Marguerite had a large debt to Van Dyke.
    - Additional Evidence: A broken pearl necklace found at the crime scene matches one Marguerite was seen wearing earlier.

    - Alibi: Claims to have been in her cabin, but no one can confirm this.
    - Alibi Update: No one saw Marguerite during the estimated time of the crime.

    - Notes: Financial motive is clear, but she is frail and may not have been able to overpower Van Dyke.
    - Additional Notes: Although Marguerite seems physically incapable of overpowering Van Dyke, she could have hired someone. 
      The broken necklace at the scene complicates things.
    
    - **If Accused** Marguerite Fontaine: If Marguerite is accused, Blythe might say, "Marguerite had a financial motive, and the broken pearl necklace at the           crime scene does raise suspicions. But let's consider her frail physical condition. The murder required strength, speed, and dexterity - traits Marguerite         unfortunately lacks. The necklace might well be a clever misdirection. She might be guilty of many things, but not this crime."

3. **Foreign Diplomat - Alexander Petrov:**
    - Evidence: Found a letter in Petrov's cabin hinting at a dispute over a diplomatic matter with Van Dyke.
    - Additional Evidence: A small Russian-to-English dictionary with marked pages on phrases related to art and theft was found in his belongings.

    - Alibi: Was seen chatting with the zeppelin's captain at the time of the murder.
    - Alibi Update: The zeppelin's captain remembers Petrov leaving briefly during their chat, but Van Dyke's room may be too far from the bridge.

    - Notes: Had a contentious relationship with Van Dyke, but his alibi checks out.
    - Additional Notes: Although Petrov's alibi holds, the presence of the dictionary might suggest he was involved in some way with the stolen painting.

    - **If Accused** Alexander Petrov: Upon accusing Petrov, Blythe might remark, "Alexander did have a brief window where he left the captain's side. The found         dictionary suggests he was learning about art and theft. But we should remember, the crime was committed with an intimate knowledge of the zeppelin,               something Petrov, being a first-time passenger, lacks. His involvement seems unlikely."

4. **Estranged Son - Jonathan Van Dyke:**
    - Evidence: Jonathan stands to inherit his father's fortune, including the insurance payout for the painting.
    - Additional Evidence: A hidden stash of gambling debts was found in Jonathan's cabin.

    - Alibi: Claims to have been in the library, but the librarian did not see him.
    - Alibi Update: Jonathan remains unaccounted for during the time of the crime.

    - Notes: Strong motive, but no physical evidence linking him to the crime.
    - Additional Notes: The financial motivation becomes even stronger with the discovery of Jonathan's gambling problem.

    - **If Accused** Jonathan Van Dyke: If the player accuses Jonathan, Blythe could respond, "While Jonathan had a clear financial motive, remember that his           familiarity with the zeppelin is limited. The route marked on the blueprint in Van Dyke's cabin is unknown to him. Additionally, the murder and theft             required a level of cunning and deception that Jonathan, in his distressed state over his gambling debts, could hardly muster."

5. **Zeppelin Captain - Captain Wallace:**
    - Evidence: Has access to all cabins, including Van Dyke's.
    - Additional Evidence: A personal log shows his discontent with Van Dyke, who he found arrogant and disrespectful.

    - Alibi: Claims to have been on the bridge. The co-pilot cannot confirm as he stepped away briefly.
    - Alibi Update: The co-pilot recalls the captain leaving the bridge unattended for a short time.

    - Notes: No clear motive, but had opportunity.
    - Additional Notes: The personal log shows motive, and the unaccounted time provides the opportunity.

    - **If Accused** Captain Wallace: If accused, Blythe might argue, "Captain Wallace had access to all cabins and certainly has grievances against Van Dyke. But       he also has a strong sense of duty and respect for his passengers. His personal log is full of frustrations, yet also dedication to his role. More                 importantly, his knowledge of the zeppelin's layout would allow for more discreet routes, not the ones marked on Van Dyke's blueprint. Wallace is more             likely a scapegoat than a culprit."

6. **Leonard Van Dyke:**
    - Evidence: Different descriptions of Van Dyke by passengers; the cryptic note hinting at illusion; a prosthetic mustache and beard found in the trash, and
        a blueprint of the Sky Empress, was he going to purchase one? Or did he want intimate details of the ship's construction? And for what?
    - Additional Evidence: Theater playbills revealing Leonard's acting skills in roles requiring complex disguises; a custom-made disguise traced back to him; an         insurance policy on the stolen painting with a large payout in case of theft; a missing passenger who matches one of Van Dyke's known disguises.

    - Notes: Leonard Van Dyke was known to enjoy disguises. Could he have faked his own death?
    - Additional Notes: Leonard's persona as an art collector could provide the perfect cover for his plan. The evidence against other suspects fits too neatly           into common criminal profiles, possibly indicating they were set up. The missing passenger could be Leonard in disguise, hiding in plain sight.

Given these comprehensive logs from his diligent investigation, Blythe could assert that while each passenger carries a degree of suspicion and motive, none of them unequivocally fit the profile of the perpetrator. The inconsistencies in the descriptions of Van Dyke, the discovery of his extensive background in disguise, the custom-made prosthetics, the sizeable insurance policy, and the mysteriously missing passenger that matches one of Van Dyke's known disguises all significantly bolster the theory that Leonard Van Dyke may have artfully orchestrated his own demise. The evidence against other suspects appears overly convenient, hinting that they might have been unsuspecting pawns in Van Dyke's audacious plan. Consequently, Blythe is drawn more resolutely towards the conclusion that Van Dyke might not be the victim, but the elusive Midnight Marauder himself.
