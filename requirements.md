# Software Requirements

## Vision

This web app will provide an interactive game experience through text storytelling and immersive narratives, engaging users to play in a murder mystery. The point of this project is to provide another medium of storytelling through interactive gameplay. In the digital age, new forms of storytelling have been emerging, and platforms such as Netflix have added interactive "choose your own adventure" type of movies into their platform.

## Scope

### In Scope

- The intro page will introduce the story to the users and provide an input form that allows the user to enter their username
- The application will store the users name as well as any evidence they collect througout the game in local storage
- The application will render the base evidence as well as any collected evidence in a logbook that the user can access and review at any time
- The application will allow the user to interact with the characters one time each and allow them to ask a question to receive some form of evidence
- The application will allow the user to guess who is guilty at any point and return an answer of whether they solved the mystery or not

### Out of Scope

- Our application will not have any score based system, only a return state of successful or unsuccessful
- Our application will not be linked to any database or have any authentication system
- Our application will not call on any external resources or API's
- Our application will not support multiplayer functionality
- Our application will not be designed for use on mobile devices
- The application will not have any user avatar or animation of characters.  The gameplay will be image and text based

## Minimum Viable Product

- The minimum viable product for us to present on demo day is at least 6 different user interactions (levels) and or choices with different outcomes. Additionally we will save the users name and progress through the levels in local storage.
- The game will show a result of successful or unsuccessful at completion of the game

## Stretch Goals

- Transitions on click of individual characters to render the character larger in the center of the screen with a new background
- Use of thematic audio cues upon certain game events
- Timer showing how long the user has been playing the game.
